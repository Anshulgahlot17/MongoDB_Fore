# Introduction
The Zomato Sales dataset provides insights into restaurant performance, customer preferences, and cost distribution. This analysis focuses on key metrics extracted from the MongoDB Atlas dashboard to evaluate trends in restaurant pricing, customer engagement, and service options.
# Key Performance Indicators
Based on the dashboard, the following KPIs were analyzed:
• Average Cost for Two: Understanding pricing trends across different restaurants.
• Restaurant Count by Price Range: Identifying the distribution of restaurants in
various cost brackets.
• Online Delivery & Table Booking Availability: Evaluating restaurant service
offerings.
• Customer Engagement (Ratings & Votes): Assessing customer interactions and
feedback.
• City-Wise Restaurant Distribution: Geographic spread of restaurants.
Key Insights 1. Pricing Trends
• The majority of restaurants fall within the 0 - 10,000 range (9,530 restaurants), indicating affordability.
• Only a few high-end restaurants exceed 100,000 in cost for two, highlighting a niche luxury dining market.
    
  2. Service Availability
• Most restaurants do not offer online delivery or table booking, suggesting a reliance on walk-in customers.
• The lack of online services could be a missed opportunity in an era dominated by food delivery platforms.

 3. Customer Engagement
• Many restaurants have low ratings and votes, indicating either poor customer satisfaction or lack of review incentives.
• Highly rated restaurants tend to be in premium price brackets.
 4. Geographic Spread
• Restaurants are concentrated in major metropolitan areas like New Delhi, with suburban areas having fewer high-rated establishments.
 
# Recommendations
• Expand Online Delivery & Table Booking: Restaurants should integrate with Zomato’s online ordering system to increase sales.
• Encourage Customer Reviews: Implement loyalty programs or discounts for customers who leave ratings to improve engagement.
• Optimize Pricing Strategies: Mid-range restaurants can adjust pricing to capture more customers from both budget and premium segments.
• Improve Service in Suburban Areas: Investing in marketing and service quality in less popular areas could help boost customer traffic.
# Future Scope
• Predictive Analytics: Implement machine learning models to predict sales trends.
• Customer Segmentation: Deeper analysis of customer demographics and
preferences.
• Real-time Monitoring: Dashboards can integrate real-time sales data for immediate
decision-making.
# Conclusion
The analysis highlights the pricing trends, service limitations, and engagement levels of Zomato-listed restaurants. While affordability is a key strength, there is potential to enhance online services and customer interaction. Strategic pricing, service expansion, and data- driven decision-making can significantly improve restaurant performance on Zomato.
